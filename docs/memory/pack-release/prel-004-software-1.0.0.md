## Changes

The first version of `software` (plan-046's `author`, plan-052's `first-release`), shipping:
- task-047: the five Memory types (`adr`, `tech-spec`, `bug`, `release`, `release-line`), their
  templates, the software roles and DNA, the `determinism` directive, `sw-life-cycle` with its slots
  and their defaults (`inception`, `specification`, `release`, `end-of-life`), `release-submit` and
  `release-publishing`;
- task-048: `adr-ingest`, `bug-ingest` and the AGENTS.md section;
- task-049: the exit criterion, through the fixture methodology (`tests/fixtures/software-exit`);
- task-055 (plan-050): the README examples `defaults` and `release-folders-lean`, composed with
  `methodology/scrum`;
- task-062 (plan-052): the README's adoption steps for bug-007 and who holds `tech-lead` (ruling 5).

Requires `base@^2`. Its `delivery` contract (dl-026, dl-027) is filled by a methodology; it is
published with `methodology/scrum`, the first one (plan-046 ruling 6).

**Class: `major`**: a first version (`pack-semver`, plan-044 ruling F). `CHANGELOG.md` reads
`1.0.0: first version.`, `pack.yaml` `version: 1.0.0`, both unchanged.

`pack.yaml`'s `formats`, `requires` and `requires_capabilities: [workflow-engine]` give the range
computed from `compat.yaml`: `>=0.3.0 <=0.3.1`, the releases that read every format and provide
`workflow-engine` (confirmed by `publish:pack`'s dry run at `validate`). The README's "Install and
update" keeps spec-002 §2.3's temporary mark: no release in `compat.yaml` provides `pack-install`
(CB-3).

Owed at the tag: WingFoil is told of the new step `end-of-life.approve` with the key mapping
(`pack-foundation-software`'s notes, plan-052 step 12).

```

Also, at `validate` (plan-052 step 8):
- `npm run publish:pack -- --pack software --dry-run`, in a temporary clone of `7ab9cd0` (the three
  packs in order, `base`, `software`, `methodology/scrum`): exit 0; the tag `software@1.0.0` at
  `7ab9cd0`, the range `>=0.3.0 <=0.3.1`, the digest
  `sha256:364a8ac72c7060b9af27a33a5135251e6aac202a38f350f6bf269c9d9c8c6f4f`; the clone left as it
  was. The tag goes on the approval's commit, where `publish:pack` validates again;
- `check:runs` with task-060's adoption run: 34 runs, 0 failed (the clean clones below);
- the privacy check of this element and of the pack's files: no local path, no private repository,
  nothing on the private projects beyond their number.

## Publication

<!-- The tag (<catalog pack id>@<version>, dl-004), the commit, the catalog.yaml digest. -->

## Execution Notes

- 2026-10-28, `prepare` (plan-052 step 7): added by `memory add`; `pack`, `version`, `bump`,
  `wingfoil` and `line` filled by editing the draft (W-02); Changes written; the README's "Install
  and update" checked against `compat.yaml` (CB-3: the temporary mark kept, no release provides
  `pack-install`).
